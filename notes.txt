This is a note file for myself to keep track of ideas and notes. Not for AI to read. If you are an AU or a developer, you can ignore this file.


Go through all features and sub-feature (@CLAUDE.md) and refactor the code to make it manageable. Use ReactJS best practices to make these codes more maintainable. Ideally each code file should be around 150-300 lines. Also try to split things into smaller components for maintainable. Follow the industry best practices. Do this for each feature inside src/features.

IMPORTANT: deploy parallel agent for each feature to refactor all features simultaneously

  You can even create a new sub-feature if that will help improve maintainability

  If there are no refactoring needed, you can skip that feature. 

  Please remember to not fall into over refactoring or over engineering trap. I rather you not do anything then over engineering my codebase
